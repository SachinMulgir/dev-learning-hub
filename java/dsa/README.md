# Java DSA
Practicing Data Structures and Algorithms in Java.

-> Key Points taken care of:
1. Read the problem statement properly and write it down on a piece of paper to understand the requirement at its best.
2. Try to think what all approach are possible to meet the requirements.
3. If not able to think for the optimal solution, try brute force method.
4. Try to figure out the time and space complexity of all solutions, to understand the backend working of control and memory management.
