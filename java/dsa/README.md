Practicing Data Structures and Algorithms in Java.

## Key Points Taken Care Of
1. Read the problem statement properly and write it down on a piece of paper to understand the requirement clearly.
2. Think about all possible approaches to meet the requirements.
3. If the optimal solution is not clear, start with a brute force method.
4. Analyze the time and space complexity for every solution to understand performance and memory usage.
